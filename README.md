#data-collection-challenge

data-collection-challenge is a project scraping, organizing, and visualizing weather data and news article about Mars from two different urls using Beautiful Soup and Splinter. Included in the repository is a README file, and two Jupyter Notebook files. Part 1 extracts titles and preview snippets for articles on the Mars news site.  Part 2 Scrapes and analyzes Mars weather data from the Mars Temperature Data Site.

A Pandas DataFrame was created from the Mars weather data and analysis was done on the number of months on Mars and how many Mars days worth of data is included in the dataset, and charts were created visualizing the average minimum daily temperature for each month, the average daily atmospheric pressure for all the months, and the number of Earth days the elapse in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.  Finally, the data was exported to a CSV file.
